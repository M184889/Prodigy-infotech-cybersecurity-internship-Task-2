# Prodigy-infotech-cybersecurity-internship-Task-2
This project demonstrates image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation in Python. The method used here is XOR-based encryption, where each pixelâ€™s RGB values are modified with a secret key to produce an encrypted (distorted) image. The same key is then applied again to recover (decrypt) the original image.
